            This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you visit or
            make a donation to trees.org (the “Site”).

            THE PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT

            When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain information about your device, including
            information about
            your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on your device. When we
            talk about
            “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we are talking both about Device Information and Order
            Information.
            Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information about the individual web pages that you view,
            what websites
            or search terms referred you to the Site, and information about how you interact with the Site. We refer to
            this
            automatically-collected information as “Device Information.”

            We collect Device Information using the following technologies:

            – “Cookies” are data files that are placed on your device or computer and often include an anonymous unique
            identifier.
            You can find more information about cookies and how to disable them here.

            – “Log files” track actions occurring on the Site, and collect data including your IP address, browser type,
            Internet
            service provider, referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps.

            – “Web beacons,” “tags,” and “pixels” are electronic files used to record information about how you browse
            the Site.

            HOW WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

            When you make a donation or purchase something from our store, as part of the buying and selling process, we
            collect the
            personal information you give us such as your name, address, and email address. We save this information in
            order to
            have a record of who has made donations or purchases, to aggregate total donations per person, and so that
            we can send
            out Certificates and receipts as needed. We will never trade, share, or sell your personal data with anyone.
            Should we
            become aware of any kind of breach in our data systems where your personal information may be compromised,
            we will
            immediately notify you.

            When you browse our website, we also automatically receive your computer’s internet protocol (IP) address in
            order to
            provide us with information that helps us learn about your browser and operating system.

            We also use the Device Information mentioned above to help us screen for potential risk and fraud (in
            particular, your
            IP address), and more generally to improve and optimize our Site (for example, by generating analytics about
            how our
            customers browse and interact with the Site, and to assess the success of our marketing and advertising
            campaigns).

            We also use Google Analytics to help us understand how our donors use the Site. You can read more about how
            Google uses
            your Personal Information here. You can also opt-out of Google Analytics here.

            Additionally, we may use your Personal Information to provide you with targeted advertisements or marketing
            communications we believe may be of interest to you. For more information about how targeted advertising
            works, you can
            visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s (“NAI”) educational page here. You can opt out of some of these
            services by
            visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance’s opt-out portal here.

            EMAIL COMMUNICATIONS

            When you provide us with personal information to complete a donation or transaction, sign up for our
            newsletter, sign up
            to become a business partner or ambassador, or join our network of field partners, your information will be
            stored in
            our email platform so that we can send you project updates, news, or other messages via email. When you take
            certain
            actions, such as submitting your first donation as a new partner, you will be tagged in our system to
            receive some
            automated communications based on those actions. This helps ensure that you get only the most appropriate
            emails, and
            that we can properly categorize individuals to receive content relevant to you. Our emails are generally
            sparse and we
            take care not to bombard you with too much information or marketing. You can unsubscribe at any time at the
            bottom of
            any email, or simply contact us in order to be removed from these lists.

            CONSENT

            When you provide us with personal information to make a donation or complete a transaction, verify your
            credit card, or
            use a web form to receive information, we imply that you consent to our collecting it and using it for that
            specific
            reason. If you would like to withdraw your consent or request that we delete your personal information at
            any time, you
            may contact us to let us know.

            If you are a European resident, you have the right to access personal information we hold about you and to
            ask that your
            personal information be corrected, updated, or deleted. If you would like to exercise this right, please
            contact us.

            Additionally, if you are a European resident we note that we are processing your information in order to
            fulfill
            contracts we might have with you (for example if you make an order through the Site), or otherwise to pursue
            our
            legitimate business interests listed above. Additionally, please note that your information will be
            transferred outside
            of Europe, including to Canada and the United States.

            When you place an order through the Site, we will maintain your Order Information for our records unless and
            until you
            ask us to delete this information.

            DISCLOSURE

            We may disclose your personal information if we are required by law to do so or if you violate our Terms of
            Service. We
            will never disclose your personal information publicly.

            SHOPIFY

            Our store is hosted on Shopify Inc. They provide us with the online e-commerce platform that allows us to
            promote our
            products and services to you. Feel free to review Shopify’s Privacy Policy and how they address
            donor/customer privacy
            directly.

            Your data is stored through Shopify’s data storage, databases, and the general Shopify application. They
            store your data
            on a secure server behind a firewall.

            PAYMENT

            If you choose a direct payment gateway to complete your purchase, then Shopify stores your credit card data.
            It is
            encrypted through the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS). Your purchase transaction data
            is stored
            only as long as is necessary to complete your purchase transaction. After that is complete, your purchase
            transaction
            information is deleted.

            All direct payment gateways adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards
            Council,
            which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover.

            PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card information by our store and its service
            providers.
            For more insight, you may also want to read Shopify’s Terms of Service.

            THIRD-PARTY SERVICES

            In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use, and disclose your information to
            the extent
            necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to us.

            However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment transaction
            processors, have
            their own privacy policies in respect to the information we are required to provide to them for your
            donation or
            purchase-related transactions.

            For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can understand the manner in
            which your
            personal information will be handled by these providers.

            In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or have facilities that are located a
            different
            jurisdiction than either you or us. So if you elect to proceed with a transaction that involves the services
            of a
            third-party service provider, then your information may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in
            which that
            service provider or its facilities are located.

            As an example, if you are located in Canada and your transaction is processed by a payment gateway located
            in the United
            States, then your personal information used in completing that transaction may be subject to disclosure
            under United
            States legislation, including the Patriot Act.

            Once you leave our website or are redirected to a third-party website or application, you are no longer
            governed by this
            Privacy Policy or our website’s Terms of Service.

            When you click on links on our Site, they may direct you away from our site. We are not responsible for the
            privacy
            practices of other sites and encourage you to read their privacy statements.

            SECURITY

            To protect your personal information, we take reasonable precautions and follow industry best practices to
            make sure it
            is not inappropriately lost, misused, accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed.

            If you provide us with your credit card information, the information is encrypted using secure socket layer
            technology
            (SSL) and stored with a AES-256 encryption. Although no method of transmission over the Internet or
            electronic storage
            is 100% secure, we follow all PCI-DSS requirements and implement additional generally accepted industry
            standards.

            Where a Data Subject is located in the European Economic Area, that Data Subject’s Personal Data will be
            processed by
            Shopify’s Irish affiliate, Shopify International Ltd. As part of providing the Services, this Personal Data
            may be
            transferred to other regions, including to Canada and the United States. Such transfers will be completed in
            compliance
            with relevant Data Protection Legislation.

            COOKIES

            A cookie is a small amount of information that’s downloaded to your computer or device when you visit
            certain websites.
            We use a number of different cookies through Shopify, all the details for which can be found here.

            AGE OF CONSENT

            By using this site, you represent that you are at least the age of majority in your state or province of
            residence, or
            that you are the age of majority in your state or province of residence and you have given us your consent
            to allow any
            of your minor dependents to use this site.

            CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY

            We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time, so please review it frequently. Changes and
            clarifications will take effect immediately upon their posting on the website. If we make material changes
            to this
            policy, we will notify you here that it has been updated, so that you are aware of what information we
            collect, how we
            use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we use and/or disclose it. If our website is acquired or
            merged with
            another company, your information may be transferred to the new owners so that we may continue to sell
            products to you.
