            Trees for the Future is a 501(c)3 tax-exempt organization and your
            donation is tax-deductible within the guidelines of U.S. law. To
            claim a donation as a deduction on your U.S. taxes, please keep your
            email donation receipt as your official record. We'll send it to you
            upon successful completion of your donation.

            What is the difference between a recipient and an honoree?
          </div>
          <div class="accordian_content">
            If you choose to dedicate your gift, you'll see fields for "donor",
            "honoree" and "recipient." "Donor" is the name of the person making
            the gift. "Honoree" is the person you are donating in honor of and
            their name will be included in your dedication message. "Recipient"
            is the person that is receiving the message. Most times, the honoree
            and recipient are the same person. However, memorial gifts, or gifts
            made in honor of a child or pet, are usually sent to a loved one.

          <div class="accordian_content">
            If you choose to dedicate your donation AND notify a recipient, the
            recipient will receive a message that says "DONOR NAME has donated
            in honor of HONOREE NAME for Trees for the Future" along with the
            message you choose to include. The donor (you) will receive a
            donation receipt that includes the honoree's name. If you'd like to
            receive a copy of the dedication message, you can email
            giving@trees.org with your name, email and gift date, or the

        This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is
        collected, used, and shared when you visit or make a donation to
        trees.org (the “Site”).
        <br />
        THE PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT When you visit the Site, we
        automatically collect certain information about your device, including
        information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of
        the cookies that are installed on your device.<br />

        individual web pages that you view, what websites or search terms
        referred you to the Site, and information about how you interact with
        the Site.<br />
 <br>       We refer to this automatically-collected information as “Device
        Information.<br /><br>” We collect Device Information using the following
        technologies: – “Cookies” are data files that are placed on your device
        or computer and often include an anonymous unique identifier.<br />
   <br>     You can find more information about cookies and how to disable them
        here.<br />
   <br>     – “Log files” track actions occurring on the Site, and collect data
        including your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider,
        referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps.<br />
     <br>   – “Web beacons,” “tags,” and “pixels” are electronic files used to
        record information about how you browse the Site.<br />

        purchase something from our store, as part of the buying and selling
        process, we collect the personal information you give us such as your
        name, address, and email address.<br />
<br>        We save this information in order to have a record of who has made
        donations or purchases, to aggregate total donations per person, and so
        that we can send out Certificates and receipts as needed.<br /><br>
        We will never trade, share, or sell your personal data with anyone.<br /><br>
        Should we become aware of any kind of breach in our data systems where

<br>        When you browse our website, we also automatically receive your
        computer’s internet protocol (IP) address in order to provide us with
        information that helps us learn about your browser and operating
        system.<br /><br>
        We also use the Device Information mentioned above to help us screen for
        potential risk and fraud (in particular, your IP address), and more
        generally to improve and optimize our Site (for example, by generating
        analytics about how our customers browse and interact with the Site, and
        to assess the success of our marketing and advertising campaigns).<br<br> />
        We also use Google Analytics to help us understand how our donors use
        the Site.<br />

        a new partner, you will be tagged in our system to receive some
        automated communications based on those actions.<br />

        and other payment transaction processors, have their own privacy
        policies in respect to the information we are required to provide to
        them for your donation or purchase-related transactions.<br />
<br>        For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies
        so you can understand the manner in which your personal information will
        be handled by these providers.<br />
<br>        In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or have

        provider or its facilities are located.<br />
       <br> As an example, if you are located in Canada and your transaction is

        encrypted using secure socket layer technology (SSL) and stored with a
        AES-256 encryption.<br />
